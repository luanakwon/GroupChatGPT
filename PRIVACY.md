# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: Jul-03-2025

### 1. Data Collection
We do not store any user messages, authors, or timestamps. The bot has access to past messages only when explicitly invoked via @ mention, to generate a context-aware response. The bot does not have access to the messages that are either deleted or hidden via //pss at the time of invocation. For limited debugging purposes, the first 50 characters of each input and responses are logged to the console.

### 2. Data Retention
We do not retain any user message content or metadata beyond the scope of the active request. Console logs containing truncated message previews are ephemeral and cleared with each server session restart.

### 3. Data Security
All access credentials are stored securely and are not shared. Our database is protected against external access.

### 4. User Rights
Since we do not store personal data, there is no retained content to delete. If you have concerns about how we handle your messages, you may contact the administrator for clarification.
