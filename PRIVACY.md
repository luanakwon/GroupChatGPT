### 1. Data Collection
We store conversation summaries and timestamps to improve user experience. Full message content is not stored. However, the bot may temporarily access recent messages only when explicitly invoked via @ mention, for context-aware responses.

### 2. Data Retention
Conversation summaries and timestamps are stored indefinitely unless manually deleted by the administrator or upon user request.

### 3. Data Security
All access credentials are stored securely and are not shared. Our database is protected against external access.

### 4. User Rights
Users can request deletion of their stored conversation data by contacting the administrator.
